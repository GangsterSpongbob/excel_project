 $ Added changelog.txt to track changes in detail;
 $ Added Readme.md, which is ot be updated with project information

 $ Removed copy_text() funciton;
 $ Table::print_table() now only prints Cell::_text and not _type, also improved borders;
 $ Added two new functions to class Table: print_dimensions() and print_types();
 $ Added Table::full_print(), which combines print_dimensions(), print_table() and print_types();
 $ Moved function declaration of const char *type_to_char() to cell.h and definition to cell_def.cpp respectively;
 $ Renamed globals.h to utils.h and globals_def.cpp to utils_def.cpp;
 $ Replaced function parse_cell() with parse_row(), which parses a row and returns a Cell array;
 $ Added Table::write_to_file(), that writes table data as comma separated values to a file;
 $ Added copy constructor and operator= for Table class;
 $ Added table getter functions for rows and cols;
 $ Added user_interface() funciton that takes user input and manipulates Table objects accordingly;

 $ Added get_text_by_index() function for the Table class;

 to implement:
 ** Urgent:

 ** Future implementation reminders:
 # Fix Formula() recognition;
 # Move user_interface into separate functions;
 # implement move constructors for Cell and Table
 # Table should return no '"' at beginning and end if value is string and "" if it is invalid;
 # remove_whitespaces() Might return empty_string in the case of nullptr;
